This project is a pilot project for my learning. I am developing it based on the "Java COMPLETE 2023 Object-Oriented Programming +Projects" course by Professor @NelioAlves from DevSuperior. I am adjusting the class configurations and database connections according to the needs of my project, so the entities and relationships will be different from those observed in the course. As a complement to the course, I will implement various business rules, making the application more comprehensive for its intended purpose.
